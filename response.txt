### **Challenges and Opportunities in the Indian Beverage Market:**

*   Alcohol regulation for kombucha (0.5% limit).
*   High taxation on carbonated and sweetened beverages (40%).

*   The perception that Indian products must be cheaper and less valuable.

#### **Opportunities:**

*   Changing consumer preferences, moving away from nightclubs and alcohol towards coffee shops and healthier options.
*   The potential for ethnic Indian flavors in the global market.
*   Creating unique experiences and subcultural associations in coffee shops.
*   The shift towards health-conscious choices, offering opportunities for low-calorie and protein-infused beverages.
*   The growing trend of specialty coffee and at-home brewing.

### **Starting a New Beverage Business:**

#### **Key Considerations:**

*   Develop a strong brand story and identity
*   Focus on product quality and differentiation
*   Create unique and value in an experience.
*   Build a strong community and subculture around your brand.
*   Leverage collaborations and micro-influencers for marketing.
*   Focus on education and communicate the unique benefits of your product.
*   Choose a pricing strategy that balances accessibility and premiumization.
*   Manage costs effectively and be aware of regulations.

#### **Important takeaways to start:**

*   **Taste is King** - Even if it's a small operation, if the taste is unique, people will come.
*   **Have a differentiator outside the beverage itself** (Music, Events, Activities).
*   **Don't just be a coffee shop** - Give people something to experience as well.
*   **Find a balance between familiarity and novelty.**
*   **Don't rely purely on Quick Commerce apps to build your brand** - Build yourself then use them to sustain sales.

### **Closing Thoughts:**

*   The craft beverage space in India is still small and collaborative.
*   There's a need for more innovation and better options.
*   The key to success is building a strong brand, telling a genuine story, and creating a community around your product.
*   There is tremendous room to experiment and be creative with flavours, ingredients, and how it is experienced.

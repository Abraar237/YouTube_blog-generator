            Important takeaways to start:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Taste is King</b> - Even if it's a small operation, if the taste is unique, people will come.</li>
                <li><b>Have a differentiator outside the beverage itself</b> (Music, Events, Activities).</li>
                <li><b>Don't just be a coffee shop</b> - Give people something to experience as well.</li>
                <li><b>Find a balance between familiarity and novelty.</b></li>
                <li><b>Don't rely purely on Quick Commerce apps to build your brand</b> - Build yourself then use them to sustain sales.</li>
            </ul>
